## Features:
- Users can add ports by typing in the text box and clicking "Add". The port will then appear in the browser.
- Click "Set Sail!" to leave each port. 
- Information about the current port and next port is updated in the browser as the ship moves.
- The "Add" and "Set Sail!" buttons are disabled whilst the ship is moving between ports.
