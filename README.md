<img src="images\Screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Cruise Ships GUI" title="Cruise Ships GUI" width="400px"><br>

I completed this project using JavaScript, HTML and CSS for Command Shift bootcamp. I wrote the unit tests using Jest.

Features:
- Users can create a series of ports via an HTML form.
- The ship can set sail and dock at different ports.
- Information about the current port and next port is updated in the browser as the ship moves.
- The "Add" and "Set Sail!" buttons are disabled whilst the ship is moving between ports.
